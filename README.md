# Berlin BÃ¼rgeramt Appointment Bot
A bot that sends a notification when a buergeramt appointment is available. 
It periodically checks the given buergeramt appointment page for new appointments. It then notifies the user using Telgram.

**Please use responsibly**: Set a USER_AGENT containing contact information in case something goes wrong.
